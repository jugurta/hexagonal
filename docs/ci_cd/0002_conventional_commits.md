## Context

In order to have a coherent commit style and generate changelogs we need to decide on a commit style.

## Decision

We decided to use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style.

## Consequences

The conventional commit is a mainly adopted commit style, it's easy to use and is supported by many tools.
